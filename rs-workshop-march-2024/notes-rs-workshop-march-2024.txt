BIRD updates: 
 - BMP now sends data from all tables but soon we will be able to select the table we want
 - BMP : RFC 7854 for now experimental
    - dedicated protocol for BGP monitoring
    - disabled by default
 - BGP send hold timer is implemented 
 - Custom BGP attributes can be defined in new BIRD versions
    - New recommendation 
 - Remote syslog is now supported
 - EVPN in BIRD 


OpenBGPd updates:
 - IPv4 and IPv6 flow spec support
 - ASPA support
 - There is a feature to match all ext-communities to scrub them 

Alice LG updates:
 - Latest version is 6.1
 - Memory improvements on 6.1 version
 - Idea for supporting CBOR in order to stream data from BIRD to LG
 - Questioning if should be support for BMP
 - Some funding is needed to continue the work on that 

BCOP for official IRR databases:
 - Some network operators go to private DB to register their prefixes instead of the official DBs
 - Consequently we end up with object conflicts
 - Issues with private DBs inherit upcoming security policies like hierarchical AS-SETs
 - Policy proposal : Use only those in the 5 known RIRs
 - We will give 12 months as a grace period to allow the prefixes to be registered on the official RIRs as those net owners will need to move their objects to official DBs
 - There are many duplicates on RADB as it seems for instance AMSIX found 76 objects which are double-registered
 - Only unresolved issue so far is the ARIN legacy space
 - ARIN don’t provide neither IRR nor RPKI to legacy resources holders
    - This is an issue as we found out that there are now on the Internet 
    - Couple thousands of those legacy IP networks
    - There is no Authoritative IRR server for those IP networks and they cant be validated using RPKI
    - Access Operators leasing networks from Cogent
        - some US government entities , US universities, amateur packet radio
        - also seen DoS scrubbing centers (mostly Prolexic -> Akamai)
        - mostly US based companies which Global Carriers announce them in EU
            - Cogent leases parts of their legacy nets to transit
        - customers usually small Access operators => those are only on RADB
    - From the results : BNIX has seen 2.695 prefixes, AMS-IX 214.961 prefixes, LONAP 32.882 prefixes 
    - open discussion how access operators feel about these nets : "owning them" or "leasing them" in the end of the day.. ?

Policy for fair use of BGP communities:
 - Not enough support on this subject
 - Only AMS-IX and LINX support the idea, the rest of the community is still sceptical
 - Only supported sub-item is the 32hop AS-PATH limit

BFD Challenges:
 - some tests run by LU-CIX
 - initial 300 msec time interval very aggressive
 - above 400 msec seems stable when simple VMotion and Storage VMotion
 - 500 msec also stable couple tests have been run on a Debian 12 rs-test
 - next steps : 5 more tests with 400msec tx.

SIEM meets BIRD
 - by LU-CIX
 - All logging from the BIRD of all RS servers end up to the ELK deployment
 - 3 different setups tested and demonstrated with Centos7 and Debian 12
 - with Filebeat, rsyslog and syslog-ng 
 - Logstash for enriching the BIRD data parsing
 - Elastic as the DB for storage
 - Kibana as the visualization tool the front-end

RFC8950:
 - Supported in Junos >=17.3
 - Supported in Nokia SR-OS >=19.5
 - Bird supports it OpenBGPd not yet
 - It is possible to support 2 daemons (IPv4/IPV6) with RFC8950 as long as we use 2 different IPv6 address
 - BCIX will enable the capability on IPv6 daemon in few months

ASPA:
 - ASPA needs RFC9234 to work
 - Recommendation to enable RFC9234
 - PeeringLAN ASN needs an ASPA object with AS0
 - For transparent Route Servers we don’t need to do anything 
 - Start now, only 66 ASPA objects exist 
 - BGPsec != ASPA, ASPA is more forgiving
 - ASPA has no obligation to people to have ROA objects when creating ASPA objects

IXP-MANAGER:
 - NEW UI-Based filtering in IXP manager
 - Good idea: make pairs of RSs and check if RS-X has finidhed updating before pushing config to RS-Y
 - There are some nice script tools in the IXP-Manager repository that can be used in our deployment
 - Definition of done? Different view from our view

ROV-tools for IRR checks
 - They use RTR tools to feed Route Servers with IRR prefixes
 - RTRTR is the only tool that works reliably
 - Solution works only on Bird
 - They have a global table that matches prefixes with ASNs based on IRR data (not RPKI)
 - Their solution feeds this table
