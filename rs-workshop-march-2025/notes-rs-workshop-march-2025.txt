- Bird2 Updates
    - version 2.17 comes soon 
    - ASPA is supported in Bird 2.16
      - also via RTR version 2
    - StayRTR in ASPA might not be stable yet
    - Presentation of an ASPA Example on Bird2
    - New security improvements 
      - per session auth for BFD
      - md5 authentication for RPKI
      - TCP-AO for BGP
    - BMP is not encouraged to be used for Route Servers
    - Multiple CLI sockets support (also for restricted socket)
    - Bird3 has full feature parity with Bird2
    - The number of threads/cores can be configured in Bird3
      - Numbers of threads = numbers of cores -1 (of the main process)


- OpenBGPd updates
    - OpenBGPd 8.8 and rpki-client 9.4
    - RFC8654 increases the limit to 65535 so more attributes can be spent per prefix (old limit is 4096)
    - RFC8950 is supported (half implemented though)
    - Caching of Adj-Rib-Out over sessions restarts  (60 min) 
    - Filtered routes are now included in the local-RIB but not eligible in the decision process
    - New feature ‘transparent-as’ for allowing well known communities to pass 
    - Is possible now to enforce some BGP capabilities like 4byte ASN
    - Discussion on Ultra Long-Lived TA certs (TA certificates will have a MAX valididy period of 3 years) 


- rpki-client feature highlights:
    - Improved performance 
    - RRDP sessions reinitialized at random intervals
    - rework bird config generator
    - exclude ROAs from AS0 TALs by default
    - impose same-origin policy for RRDP
        - because HTTP redirects are bad and can cause RP and 3rd parties lots of pain
    - gradually stop accepting ultra long-lived TA certs
        - because these kind certs are security risks


- RPKI Validators market research results
    - Routinator is the most popular RPKI cache among members
    - RPKI-CLIENT is the second most popular
    - Most of the members run both flavours for redudancy
    - VIX is not doing any RPKI at all


- NETIX
    - IX in Bulgaria 
    - with more than 220 POPs
    - 4+ TB of daily exchange traffic
    - NETIX Quarantine LAN testing
        - a nice RT dynamic testing tool
        - self-developped portal for monitoring
        - RS analysis
    - Route server WEB admin Panel (which is like HTTPising the show route command of BIRD)
    - The plot graphs about prefix updates by members
    - NET-IX has a home-made Looking Glass
    - They work with IXP-watch


- AMS-IX NetOps python tool 
    - bird-route-analyzer
    - prefixes and peers discovery


- NL-IX: network facilitation with Remote Peering
    - PeeringDB has a new feature to specify the location of your router
    - Discussion on how can this new feature can be used on the route Servers 


- AMS-IX: eBGP peer flapping on bird2 conditions
    - Diving into the Route Refresh capability
    - Testing configure vs configure soft + reload in/out
    - RS import table vs RS export table 
    - Combined tests and results 
    - Flapping of BGP sessions on different scenarios


- NIX.CZ : 
    - Implementing RFC8950
    - Not his favorite RFC to work
        - support IPv4 chnnel over IPv6 BGP session only
        - no support for IPv6 over IPv4 session
        - Added mandatory GTSM support RFC 6720
            - TTL security
        - no next-hop rewrites
        - Added TCP-AO support and waiting for stable kernel
        - 16 peers about 8 ASNs 
    - They installed BIRD3 and saw the performance improvements. Reconfiguration went down from 7 seconds to 1-2
    - They are digging into an issue with bgp_community add that can cause a BGP filap.
    - They defined the threads values as amount of cores -1 
    - To make Looking glass work with BIRD3 they had to update some Regex expressions. 
    - They tried the next-hop rewrite feature. Ugly but possible 
    - They are playing with Flowspec 


    - IRRDB time consuming
        - bgpq4 is being used
        - reconfiguration happens every hour
        - Full bird RS full reconfig takes about 20 minutes
        - Filter aggregation is being used
            - per channel filters

    - Fenix project
        - Proprietary work
        - Test BGP validity members

    - Looking glass update
    - Hot topic : BFD
        - 56 out of 264 peers use BFD
        - the most strict is 1500 msec with timeout 1
        - std 15 msec with timeout 5


- CZ.NIC : TCP-AO : a way to secure BGP sessions in Bird
    - MD5 is cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use
    - Kernel of Linux 6.7 supports it as of 2024
    - Multiple keys are supported with TCP-AO
    - With TCP-AO you can use different key to send BGP traffic and different key to receive BGP traffic
    - Key negotiation
      - based on preference key selection
      - announce it as RNext KeyID 
      - received RNext ID use as Current ID 
      - or ignore it if it is unknown
  - Bird has 3 levels of key preference for configured keys 
  - Recommendation to not remove key once it is obsolete but rather use the option depreccated
  - TCP reset can be prevented with TCP-AO (also TCP-MD5 was doing that)
        
  - TTL security is faster to detect the spoofed IP packet in your Peering LAN


- NL-IX : Load Balancing the incoming traffic via RS
    - balancing traffic is desired
    - allow a network to use their full capacity with multiple routers
    - reduce impact on port errors or other issues
    - reduce size of traffic shifts during outages
    - managing your incoming traffic is difficult by definition as you have no control over the sending party


- OpenBGPd performance and scaling results:
    - Rethinking BGP performance and measurements
    - current practices :
        - measure time from cold start until all routes have been distributed
            - no ASPA validation no ROA 
            - no filters
            - minimal ASPATH and BGP attributes
    - bgp-canary :
        - new tool to track propagation delay through one or multiple BGP hops
        - needs 2 sessions to measure round trip time from sender to receiver
        - sends UPDATE every second and measures the round trip time
        - includes a counter to track if messages got merged together
    - Wants to build a tool like bgp-blaster that emulates customers based on MRT dumps



- LINX: Discussion on BGP Prefix limit strategies
    - Linx so far does not have any policy for setting prefix limits 
    - The peer informs us what to set. We guess if the limit is too high
    - currently linx have: 
      - 666 peers with less than 500 prefixes 
      - 75 peers with more than 500 prefixes 
    - Question if we should draft a BCP for that, was a good idea and encouranged by the group
    - Regarding the random value on top of the prefix limit, we believe that is not necessary. 


- Discussion over Bird2 : 
    - Better to use attributes over communities (per discussion with Maria in previous years)
    - France-IX implement it.


- Discussions on RFC 9324
    - RPKI without Route Refresh. People shouldn't route refresh
    - Similar issue with ROA Updates
    - BGP Roles OTC attributes in UPDATE and OPEN messages
    - Another tool to prevent Route Leaks
    - Important: roles are defined per session 
        - for complex peering relationship and more complexity -> better not to enable it.
    - Implemented by AMS-IX, LINX, France-IX (Lyon)


- Public Looking glass Irene Discussions 
    - LU-CIX seems to be the only IX which faces political apprehensions for it
