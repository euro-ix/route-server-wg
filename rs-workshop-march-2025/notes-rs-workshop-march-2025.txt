- Bird Updates 2.16
    - RPKI RTR version 2 ASPA
    - security improvements
        - per session auth for BFD
        - md5 authentication for RPKI
        - TCP-AO for BGP

    - dump commands to files

- Bird 3 uses 8-16 Threads/cores
    - Numbers of threads = numbers of cores -1 (of the main process)


- rpki-client feature highlights:
    - improved performance 
    - RRDP sessions reinitialized at random intervals
    - rework bird config generator
    - exclude ROAs from AS0 TALs by default
    - impose same-origin policy for RRDP
        - because HTTP redirects are bad and can cause RP and 3rd parties lots of pain
    - gradually stop accepting ultra long-lived TA certs
        - because these kind certs are security risks


- RPKI Validators market research results
    - Routinator 
    - rpki-client with stayRTR 
    - the most popular and used by us.

- NETIX
    - IX in Bulgaria 
    - with more than 220 POPs
    - 4+ TB of daily exchange traffic
    - NETIX Quarantine LAN testing
        - a nice RT dynamic testing tool
        - self-developped portal for monitoring
        - RS analysis

- AMS-IX NetOps python tool 
    - bird-route-analyzer
    - prefixes and peers discovery

- NIX.CZ : 
    - Implementing RFC8950
        - support IPv4 chnnel over IPv6 BGP session only
        - no support for IPv6 over IPv4 session
        - Added mandatory GTSM support RFC 6720
            - TTL security
        - no next-hop rewrites
        - Added TCP-AO support and waiting for stable kernel
        - 16 peers about 8 ASNs 


    - IRRDB time consuming
        - bgpq4 use
        - every hour their prefix generation
        - their full bird RS full reconfig takes about 20 minutes
        - filter aggregation use
            - per channel filters


    - Fenix project
        - Proprietary work
        - Test BGP validity members

    - Looking glass update
    - Hot topic : BFD
        - 56 out of 264 peers use BFD
        - the most strict is 1500 msec with timeout 1
        - std 15 msec with timeout 5


- DE-CIX: Peering LAN global reachability tests
    -
    -
    -
    - peering LANs are highly visible in the DFZ
    - IXPs don't have control as AS0 ROAs don't help
    - BGP monitoring is pointless if there is no BGP visibility
    - Any infra insode a peering LAN is reachable from a high amount of DDoS reflectors
    - BCP194 and RFC 7454 should be updated to discourage downstream announcements of peering LAN prefixes.
    -
    -
    - RS and Routers in the Peering LAN should be treated as public infra
    - IXPs shouldn't base network designs on invisibility 
    - IXP operators should rate limit or block traffic from external IPs into the Peering LAN


- CZ.NIC : TCP-AO : a way to secure BGP sessions in Bird
        - MD5 is cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use
        - Key negotiation
            - based on preference key selection
            - announce it as RNext KeyID 
            - received RNext ID use as Current ID 
            - or ignore it if it is unknown
        
        - TTL security is faster to detect the spoofed IP packet in your Peering LAN

- NL-IX : Load Balancing the incoming traffic via RS
    - balancing traffic is desired
    - allow a network to use their full capacity with multiple routers
    - reduce impact on port errors or other issues
    - reduce size of traffic shifts during outages
    - managing your incoming traffic is difficult by definition as you have no control over the sending party


- OpenBGPd performance and scaling results:
    - rethinking BGP performance and measurements
    - current practices :
        - measure time from cold start until all routes have been distributed
            - no ASPA validation no ROA 
            - no filters
            - minimal ASPATH and BGP attributes
    - bgp-canary :
        - new tool to track propagation delay through one or multiple BGP hops
        - needs 2 sessions to measure round trip time from sender to receiver
        - sends UPDATE every second and measures the round trip time
        - includes a counter to track if messages got merged together


- LINX: Discussion on BGP Prefix limit strategies
        - peering DB
        - peer informs us what to set
        - guess if the limit is too high
        - currently linx have : 
            - 666 peers with less than 500 prefixes 
            - 75 peers with more than 500 prefixes

- Bird2 : better to use attributes over communities
        - as we discussed with Maria in previous years
        - France-IX implement it.


- Discussions on RFC 9324
    - RPKI without Route Refresh
    - people shouldn't route refresh
    - similar issue with ROA Updates


- Discussions on RFC 9234 
    - BGP Roles OTC attributes in UPDATE and OPEN messages
    - another tool to prevent Route Leaks
    - important: roles are defined per session 
        - for complex peering relationship and more complexity -> better not to enable it.
    - AMS-IX, LINX, France-IX (Lyon)


- Public Looking glass Irene Discussions 
    - LU-CIX seems to be the only IX which faces political apprehensions for it
